This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Extension and the choices you have associated with that data.

## Information Collection and Use

We do not collect or store any personal data from users of the Extension. The Extension operates entirely in the browser and does not transmit any information to our servers or third parties.

## Permissions

The Extension requires the following permissions to function properly:

**activeTab**: This permission allows the Extension to access the currently active tab to extract colors and fonts from the website you are visiting.

**Host permission**: This permission is required to run content scripts on all websites (http://*/* and https://*/*) to ensure the Extension can function on any site you visit.

These permissions are used solely for the purpose of providing the features of the Extension. No data is collected or transmitted outside your local machine.
